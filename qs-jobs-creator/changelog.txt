--------WHATS NEW------------------------
Added Qs Text UI marker type support (if not available, it will fallback to default 3D text).
Migrated settings from config.lua to the in-game menu â€” these can also be edited in config.json.
Real-time configuration changes: you can now toggle debug, adjust 3D text rendering (font, size, etc.), arcade impound, insta arrest, anti-AFK farming, and more directly in-game.
Added new translations and updated some existing translations for better localization.
Fixed random issues with the Boss Menu.
Corrected translation errors and inconsistencies.
Removed the default development config.json (the script will now generate a new one with default data at startup).
Fixed random issues with QS Matrix.
